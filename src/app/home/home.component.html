    <p>My name is Matthew. I'm a full-stack, jack-of-all-trades, solutions expert working in the field of technology.<img src="assets/personal-photo.jpg" /></p>
    <p>While playing on my dad's work computer running Windows 95 at a young age, I found myself fascinated with computers. I would explore its many features and programs and quickly became a teacher to my dad's coworkers on how to operate these machines that they had been given to use. That event sparked something within me that I carry to this day: the drive to leverage technology for the betterment of everyone.</p>
    <p>Having worked in the field of technology for the past 15 years, I've done a little bit of everything from building computers, managing multiple CRM systems, creating web applications, automating tasks, assembling tools to monitor a datacenter, and more. Currently, I'm a working manager, splitting my time between development tasks and leading a team of individuals focused on IT data projects. The team covers Salesforce, numerous internal applications, and on-prem servers and represents a vast array of languages and technologies employed as part of those tasks. But my first love is still development so when I don't get the time to work on projects while on the job, I work on personal projects in my free time.</p>
