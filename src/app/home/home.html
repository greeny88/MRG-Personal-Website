    <p>My name is Matthew. I'm a full-stack, jack-of-all-trades, solutions expert working in the field of technology.<img src="personal-photo.jpg" /></p>
    <p>From a young age playing on my dad's work computer running Windows 95, I found myself fascinated with computers. I would explore its many features and programs and quickly became a teacher to my dad's coworkers on how to operate these machines that they had been given to use. That event sparked something within me that I carry to this day: the drive to leverage technology for the betterment of everyone.</p>
    <p>Having worked in the field of technology for the past 15 years, I’ve done a little bit of everything from building computers, managing multiple CRM systems, creating web applications, automating tasks, assembling tools to monitor a datacenter, and more. Currently, I’ve settled into a software engineer position that uses Python, Javascript, SQL, and Java on a regular basis along with all of the various tools, frameworks, and applications related to that. But my drive to do more has not stopped and so I’m continuing to learn as technology pushes on. For example, Google Cloud and Ansible are tools I’m learning as part of a project to migrate an on-premise datacenter into a new location.</p>
